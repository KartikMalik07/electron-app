        🐘 Airavat v1.0.0 - Model Setup

        📥 AI Models Required (Separate Download)

        Due to GitHub file size limitations, model files are not included in v1.0.0.

        🔗 Download Options:
        1. **Wait for v2.0.0**: Models will be included in the next release
        2. **Manual Setup**: Train your own models using the provided scripts
        3. **Contact Developer**: Request access to pre-trained models

        📁 Required Files:
        - python-backend/models/siamese_best_model.pth (~100MB)
        - python-backend/models/yolo_best_model.pt (~12MB)

        🏗️ Training Your Own Models:
        - Follow the training scripts in the repository
        - Requires elephant dataset (not included)
        - Estimated training time: 4-8 hours on modern GPU

        ⚡ Quick Start Without Models:
